## 🧠 About Me

I'm a software engineer with a Bachelor's degree in **Information Technology** from International Burch University.  
I enjoy building full-stack applications that solve real problems — from backend logic to intuitive front-end interfaces.

During my academic and internship experience, I've worked on:
- Real-world projects using **Java Spring Boot** and **Angular**
- A custom **Student Information System** using **PHP (FlightPHP)**, **Swagger**, and front-end tools
- Personal projects using technologies like **React**, **MongoDB**, and **Python**
